## Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

## Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- What kind of people has a voice in the media? E.g. occupation, gender, age, ethnicity, etc.
- What do they need to talk about? More precisely, investigate this question as a function of speaker's profile (e.g. quotation topics for different ethnicities, etc.)
- How do they need to say it?
- How does the answer to the previous questions changed over time?

## Additional datasets
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

## Methods

- __Text classification__ for answering the "what". More precisely, our project requires to be able to automatically find quotations' topics: for example among {politics, U.S., world, economy, business, sport, science, technology, culture}. The approach used is called "zero-shot text classification" and is described in [this notebook](find_topics_100k.ipynb).
- __Sentiment analysis__
